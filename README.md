# Mandel_Brot (Fractal) 

We will generate images in the Mandel Brot which is a set of well known fractal structure. <br />
The above code increases the efficiency of the code by 500%. <br />
The images genreated are in .bmp <br />
You can zoom into any part and find swirls, spirals, snowflakes, and other fun structures, as long as you are inputting different computation <br />
